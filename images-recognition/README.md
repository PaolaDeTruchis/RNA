# images-rocognition

This is the first project of the RNA course

This directory is composed of :
  - the MNIST data-base to train theartificial neural networks(ANN)
  - "exe_red.py" the main program (to run everything)
  - the nework class (the ANN)
  - the mnist_loader class (to run the training data)

There are 4 different branches:

"main" with the cuadratic eror as loss function
"cross_entropy", where I changed the loss function with Cross Entropy
"SGDmomentum" and "RMSprop" with two different optimizer with cross entropy function)
